# Collisions in Los Angeles County
### Group Members: Emily Cadena, Gema Martinez, and Veronica De Santos 

Our research focuses on the question: <ins>Who’s Most at Risk? Social Demographics and Traffic Collisions in Los Angeles County<ins>

This research is significant because it gives an understanding of the social demographic factors that make certain populations more vulnerable to collisions. The research can help identify high-risk areas, enabling agencies to prioritize safety improvements and implement countermeasures effectively. This study serves as a foundation to preserve lives and reduce traffic violence, leveraging education campaigns targeting the most affected communities, highlighting traffic safety as a critical public health issue. Also, witnessing street design inequities, such as low-income communities of color being left with no choice but to navigate dangerous sidewalks without traffic regulation, drives our curiosity to explore if similar patterns exist across other demographic groups in Los Angeles County.
This study focuses on Los Angeles County, one of the most populated counties in the United States. Los Angeles County as our study area is important because it includes diverse communities that face varying levels of collision vulnerability. On the other hand, collisions have been increasing (as reported by the Los Angeles Times for the City of Los Angeles), making it significant to address. We aim to evaluate the demographic groups more susceptible to fatal and serious injuries using the SCAG High Injury Network. We are specifically trying to identify any common sociodemographic characteristics of areas with a concentration of HIN segements. 

We will use the following data sources for our analysis:
 
  **1. [SWITRS Collision Data](https://tims.berkeley.edu/summary.php)**
  - Data on traffic collisions across Los Angeles County.

  **2. [American Community Survey (ACS) Census Data (2019–2023)](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs)**
   - Demographic variables include race/ethnicity, median household income, and age.

  **3. [SCAG High Injury Network](https://transportation-safety-scag.hub.arcgis.com/pages/high-injury-network)** 

Our analysis will involve combining combining/overlapping the HIN data with demographic data to explore the relationships between social demographics and collision vulnerability. We plan to create the following visualizations:
- A map overlaying HIN data and demographic characteristics to identify high-risk populations.
  - Race/Ethnicity
  - Median Household Income
  - Age


From this research, we anticipate developing an understanding of how demographic factors correlate with traffic collisions, highlighting the most affected areas and populations. We will also gain insights into the spatial and demographic patterns of collision vulnerability in Los Angeles County. Specifically, as race/ethnicity may emerge as a primary factor influencing collision risk, and vulnerable populations, such as those with lower incomes or older adults, are likely to be disproportionately impacted by traffic violence. Overall, this research will deepen our spatial understanding of Los Angeles County, and inform us on areas to promote strategies to make transportation systems safer and more equitable for all.

Our interest in centering Los Angeles County in our research project stems from our shared connection in the areas, where we live, work, and engage with diverse communities. Understanding the spatial and temporal trends in this region will help inform policies that improve safety for residents, visitors, and commuters alike.
