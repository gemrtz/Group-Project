# Group Mini Update 

**Project Title:** Who’s Most at Risk? Social Demographics and Traffic Collisions in Los Angeles County

**Link to Proposal:** https://github.com/gemrtz/Group-Project/blob/main/GroupAssignments/readme.md


**Roles:** 

  **Emily: Race and Ethnicity Data Lead**
  - Responsibilities: Evaluating traffic collision distribution with race and ethnicity
  - Contribution to Project:
    - Conduct data exploration for traffic collision distribution with race and ethnicity
     - Produce 1 chart on the overlay between traffic collisions and race/ethnicity
     - Produce 1 static map or one interactive map on the overlay between traffic collisions and race/ethnicity
      
  **Gema: Income Distribution Data Lead and Group Repo Holder**
  - Responsibilities: Evaluating traffic collision distribution with income 
  - Contribution to Project:
    - Conduct data exploration for traffic collision distribution with income distribution
    - Produce 1 chart on the overlay between traffic collisions and income distribution
    - Produce 1 static map or one interactive map on the overlay between traffic collisions and race/ethnicity

 **Veronica: Age Distribution Data Lead & PM/Notetaker**
  - Responsibilities: Evaluating traffic collision distribution with age distribution
  - Contribution to Project:
    - Conduct data exploration for traffic collision distribution with age distribution
    - Produce 1 chart on the overlay between traffic collisions and age distribution
    - Produce 1 static map or one interactive map on the overlay between traffic collisions and age distribution

**Status Update:** 
Our weekly meetings are held on Saturday mornings since the weekdays are filled with classes and work. We have characterized our meetings as collaborative and productive because our brainstorming sessions enable us to share feedback, ask questions, and flag potential concerns. We also have a group chat where we provide quick updates and ask questions. 

Currently, we do not feel prepared to present just yet as we are refining our project and determining what’s feasible. For example, can our selected data sources merge to ensure we craft a cohesive narrative?

**Data Update:** 
**1. Demographics/Socioeconomic:** https://data.census.gov/table/ACSST1Y2023.S0501?q=S0501:%20Selected%20 
- Characteristics%20of%20the%20Native%20and%20 Foreign-Born%20Populations
Each of us will pull demographic/socioeconomic data (ex. race/ethnicity. income, & age) from the US Census Bureau, specifically the ACS 5-year Estimates (2019 - 2023)

**2. TIGER/Line Data:** https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/tiger-line-file.html  
- This data will be used to merge tabular data and census tracts

**3. SCAG Regional High Injury Network (HIN):** https://hub.scag.ca.gov/datasets/bd9cb286336d456da13fda6d1d6518d2_0/explore 
- HIN is a network of corridors where the highest concentrations of collisions occur.

**Concerns:** 
Our primary concern is balancing learning Python, and applying the learned skill set to our research question while working on our capstone projects. In addition, we are having some difficulties in narrowing down our project scope in terms of feasibility, and cohesiveness.
